/**
 * Convergence strategy.
 * Here is the simplest implementation of the {@link ChoosingStrategy}.
 * It uses the {@link Convergence} to choose the next rule.
 * Pay attention that the single instance of the strategy must be used only for single generation
 * branch.
 * So, we need to copy the strategy for each new generation branch.
 * Otherwise, the convergence state will be shared between the branches
 * which will lead to the infinite recursion.
 * You can read more about this implementation from this interesting
 * <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/01/28/generating-random-sentences-from-a-context-free-grammar/">article</a>.
