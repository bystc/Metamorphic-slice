 * Left to right rule.
 * This rule traverses the rules from left to right and correctly applies the context.
 * I've tried to rewrite this class to some sort of machine that would traverse the rules and
 * apply the context to them, but failed.
 * The solution with machine looks pretty overcomplicated, at least with the current design.
 * You can check it here: https://github.com/volodya-lombrozo/jsmith/tree/106_machine
 * So, we need to keep this class to correctly transfer context from one rule to another, from
 * left to right.
